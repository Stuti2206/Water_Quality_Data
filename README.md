This project focuses on predicting the water quality level using supervised machine learning algorithms. The goal is to classify whether the given water sample is safe or unsafe for consumption based on various chemical and microbial properties present in the dataset.

Business Case

Access to clean and safe drinking water is a fundamental need. Contaminated water poses serious health risks, including exposure to harmful chemicals and microorganisms. In this project, we aim to create a predictive system that can assess water potability using measurable features such as:

Heavy Metals: Aluminium, Arsenic, Barium, Cadmium, Chromium, Lead, Mercury, Silver, Uranium

Chemical Compounds: Ammonia, Chloramine, Copper, Fluoride, Nitrates, Nitrites, Perchlorate, Selenium

Biological Contaminants: Bacteria, Viruses

Radioactive Elements: Radium

Target Column: is_safe (1 = Safe, 0 = Unsafe)
